# BuddySplit-HacknRoll-2022
HacknRoll 2022 Hackathon Project - BuddySplit
BuddySplit is a receipt scanner application that helps you to store and split the bills.

## What it does
BuddySplit will help the users to split their bills. The user will scan their receipt using BuddySplit, they will be prompted to answer a few questions such as how many payees, the GST percentage, and service charge percentage. Then, they will select the items they purchased. Finally, BuddySplit will calculate the individual bills and output them to the user. The user can then share it amongst the others.

## How we built it
We wrote the application using React Native and frameworks such as UI-Kitten, expo, tailwind-rn, and expo-camera. We have also included external APIs such as google vision API for the image to text recognition feature in our application. We tested the application core features such as the page navigation and OCR feature using phone emulators from Android Studio.

## Features:
* Scan receipt and list out all items
* Assign specific items to different payees to ensure accurate repayment
* Store past receipts for budget tracking
* Share receipt to remind friends to repay you

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Good team coordination, our team is splitter into 2 groups: one works with the Front-end of the app, and the other works with the back-end of the app. We managed to get some of the core features up and working.

2. Successful integration of the Google Vision API into our application.  After hours of debugging and REST API Testing, our team managed to interact with the google vision API to get the OCR feature of the app working.

3. Figma prototype to UI translation. Our team started off with the Figma framework and successfully transformed it into the front-end of the application.

## What we learned
1. We have learned to read up the documentation and try out the features.

2. We have learned to work in a team and have good communication skills to get the work done.

3. We have learned to deploy and integrate external APIs into our application.

## What's next for BuddySplit
1. We aim to continue to work on the other features of the application such as the sharing feature where the user can share the generated receipt.
